# CVE Research Toolkit - TODO List

## Current Session Status (2025-06-15) ✅ **HIGH-PRIORITY CISA KEV ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

Successfully implemented the first high-priority enhancement from the comprehensive data source audit:

### ✅ **Comprehensive Data Source Audit**
**Scope**: Systematic examination of all 5 data source layers to identify missing fields and enhancement opportunities.

**Method**: 
- Examined actual data source structures (Trickest markdown, EPSS APIs, Patrowl JSON, CISA KEV) 
- Compared current extraction logic with available fields
- Identified gaps in data extraction across all connectors
- Documented enhancement recommendations with priority ratings

**Key Findings**:
- **TrickestConnector**: Missing CVE metadata, product info, CWE classification, structured badges from markdown
- **ThreatContextConnector**: Missing FIRST.org EPSS date stamps, VEDAS scores, temporal data
- **PatrowlConnector**: Missing vendor advisory categorization, reference classification, assigner details
- **MITREConnector**: Missing 4 critical CISA KEV fields including ransomware campaign data

**Documentation**: Complete audit findings documented in `DATA_SOURCE_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`

### ✅ **Identified Enhancement Opportunities by Priority**

### ✅ **CISA KEV Enhancement Implementation COMPLETED**

- [x] Updated _build_research_data function to propagate enhanced CISA KEV data from MITREConnector
- [x] Added new CSV export columns: "Ransomware Campaign Use", "KEV Vulnerability Name", "KEV Vendor Project", "KEV Product"
- [x] Updated Excel export to include same enhanced CISA KEV fields
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing KEV fields

**Technical Details**:
1. **ThreatContext Dataclass Enhancement**: Added 4 new fields for enhanced CISA KEV data
2. **Data Propagation**: Modified threat context building to extract and populate new fields from kev_info
3. **Export Enhancement**: Both CSV and Excel exports now include the new threat prioritization fields
4. **Type Safety**: All new fields properly typed with appropriate defaults

**Result**: CISA KEV data now includes critical ransomware campaign intelligence and detailed vulnerability metadata for enhanced threat prioritization.

### ✅ **Patrowl Reference Classification Implementation COMPLETED**

- [x] Enhanced description fallback when foundational descriptions are minimal

**Technical Details**:
1. **Metadata Extraction**: Regex-based extraction of product badges, CWE badges, and descriptions from markdown
2. **Technology Detection**: Pattern matching for 5 technology categories (Platform, Web Server, Database, Runtime, CMS)
3. **Exploit Maturity Logic**: Priority-based assessment (weaponized > functional > proof-of-concept > unproven)
