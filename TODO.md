## CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS

### **UI Enhancement - MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED**

#### **Component Architecture Refactor (COMPLETED)**
- [x] **Modular Component System** - Broke apart 1,400+ line monolithic App.tsx
- [x] **Pagination Layout Fix** - Updated CSS flexbox to prevent pagination from being cut off
- [x] **Clean Field Display** - Phase 1 enhanced sections now hidden when empty (no more N/A displays)
- [x] **Date Field Removal** - All temporal fields removed per user preference
- [x] **Professional UI** - ODIN color scheme and proper component organization

#### **Data Quality & UI Integration Achievement**
- **Evidence-Based Enhancement**: Every field verified with actual CVE data before implementation
- **Source Verification**: Confirmed all data exists in external sources
- **Field Cleanup**: Removed unmappable fields to eliminate blank columns
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive validation with real-world CVEs
- **UI Integration**: Complete web interface tested and functional with all new fields
- **Backend Integration**: FastAPI backend successfully serves all 80 fields
- **Frontend Integration**: React UI displays new data with updated color scheme

### **CRITICAL DATA PIPELINE ISSUE - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Phase 1 enhanced fields (Enhanced Problem Type, Product Intelligence, Control Mappings) were being extracted by connectors but not reaching API response
- **Root Cause**: Engine mapping bug - attempting to map non-existent fields ('type', 'description') to EnhancedProblemType
- **Resolution**: Fixed field mappings in engine to match actual data model structure
- **Verification**: All 80+ fields now correctly flow from connectors → engine → API → UI
- **Status**: RESOLVED - All Phase 1 enhanced fields now functional

### **VERSION MANAGEMENT & RELEASE AUTOMATION - COMPLETE**
- **Version System**: Comprehensive version tracking with automatic updates on PR merge
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated version bumps based on PR labels (major, minor, patch)
- **Release Automation**: Automatic GitHub releases with download packages
- **GitHub Labels**: User added major/minor/patch labels to repository for version control
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Full version management and release automation operational

### **MARKDOWN EXPORT MAINTENANCE MORATORIUM**
- **Status**: Markdown export is severely outdated (only 19% field coverage vs 80-field data model)
- **Policy**: DO NOT maintain, touch, or modify markdown export - WILL BE REMOVED
- **Future Work**: Complete removal planned - not worth maintaining vs fixing API
- **Current State**: Functional but provides incomplete intelligence coverage

---

## CRITICAL PRIORITY - DATA QUALITY ISSUES REMAINING
