from cve_research_toolkit import VulnerabilityResearchEngine, ResearchReportGenerator

# Direct usage
main_research(input_file='cves.txt', format=['json', 'markdown'])

# CLI entry point
cli_main()
```

### Next Steps:
The CLI extraction is complete and fully functional. The modular structure allows for:
- Easy testing of individual components
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable modules across different entry points
- Maintained backward compatibility

All tests pass and the CLI maintains full functionality from the original monolithic file.
