# CVE Research Toolkit - TODO List

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Reliability (High Priority)

- [ ] Modularize the codebase into separate packages for models, connectors, core engine, and reporting
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions and retry logic
- [ ] Add performance optimization with connection pooling and batch processing (no caching - workstation based)
- [ ] Enhance type safety with Pydantic models and proper type hints
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing with fixtures and mocks
- [ ] Improve security with input validation and rate limiting

## Phase 2: Enhanced OSINT & Research Capabilities (High Priority)

- [ ] Design evidence-based mechanical analysis framework for exploitation prerequisites
- [ ] Build environmental condition extraction system (OS requirements, configuration dependencies, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate CVEfixes repository for before/after code analysis
- [ ] Create local web UI wrapper for interactive data consumption and analysis
- [ ] Add CVE cross-referencing functionality in Excel output (core feature)

## Phase 3: Second Tier Data Layers & Control Mapping (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Implement CWE-based control framing system to map weakness categories to control families
- [ ] Implement CVE2CAPEC integration for systematic CVE→CWE→CAPEC→ATT&CK mapping
- [ ] Implement MITRE framework integration (CWE, CAPEC, ATT&CK) for systematic analysis
- [ ] Redesign compensating controls automation using evidence-based matching
- [ ] Enhance Excel/Word output with technical deep-dive sections and templated analysis frameworks (future)

## Phase 4: Advanced Research Features (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create plugin architecture for easy extension with new data sources
- [ ] Implement monitoring with metrics and health checks
- [ ] Enhance documentation with better docstrings and examples

## Experimental/Research Items (Low Priority)

- [ ] Explore CVE cross-referencing within batches (experimental branch)
- [ ] Research vulnerability analysis frameworks for systematic prerequisite extraction

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze code structure and organization
- [x] Review error handling and logging patterns
- [x] Evaluate performance bottlenecks
- [x] Assess type safety and data validation
- [x] Review API design and extensibility
- [x] Document improvement recommendations
- [x] Analyze UX, architecture, and business value opportunities
- [x] Clarify project scope and purpose (OSINT research tool, not vulnerability management platform)
- [x] Research all existing data source organizations for additional OSINT opportunities
- [x] Design Second Tier Data Layers architecture for CVE-to-control mapping
- [x] Validate CWE-based control framing approach
- [x] Determine strategic implementation sequence (modularization → data sources → UI)
