# ODIN Development TODO

## Current Priority: Phase 2 Feature Implementation

### Phase 2: Strategic Enhancements (In Progress)

#### **Reference Intelligence Enhancement** (High Priority)
- Extract reference tags and types from CVE JSON
- Add reference.tags, reference.type, reference.name fields  
- Implement automated categorization (patches, advisories, exploits)
- Enhance reference intelligence in CVEProjectConnector
- Update data models with new reference fields
- Test reference extraction and categorization

#### **Badge-based Technology Stack** (Medium Priority)
- Parse Trickest badge metadata from shields.io URLs
- Extract technology stack information from badges
- Add product_badges, cwe_badges, exploit_availability fields
- Integrate badge parsing into TrickestConnector
- Update data models with technology fields

#### **Web UI Overhaul** (High Priority)
- Implement ODIN color scheme (#0D1B2A, #1B263B, #56CFE1, #FFC300, #E0E1DD, #778DA9)
- Redesign layout and navigation for better usability
- Update component styling to match ODIN branding
- Improve data visualization and grid layouts
- Enhance responsive design for different screen sizes
- Clean up existing poor UI/UX elements
- Test frontend functionality with new enhanced data fields

### Infrastructure & Quality Assurance

#### **Testing Requirements**
- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive E2E tests covering full data pipeline
- **Connector Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all modular connectors
- **API Testing**: Full API endpoint coverage with request/response validation
- **Frontend Testing**: Component tests for enhanced displays and UI redesign
- **Data Pipeline Testing**: Verify complete CVE research workflow end-to-end
- **Export Testing**: Validate CSV/JSON exports with all enhanced fields
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for batch CVE processing
- Maintain 100% test passing rate across all test categories

#### **Code Quality**
- Run type checking after backend changes
- Run npm run typecheck after frontend changes
- Validate API response schemas
- Ensure all new fields populate in CSV/JSON exports
- Frontend linting and code formatting for UI components

#### **Documentation Updates**
- Update DATA_DICTIONARY.md with new fields
- Update DATA_LINEAGE.md with new extraction sources
- Document API changes and new endpoints
- Update UI documentation with new design patterns

#### **Modular Connector System Documentation** (High Priority)
- **Complete Connector Architecture Guide**: Document the modular connector system design
- **Connector Development Guide**: How to create new connectors and extend existing ones
- **Data Layer Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the 5-layer data architecture
- **Field Mapping Documentation**: Complete mapping of all extracted fields to sources
- **Connector API Reference**: Full API documentation for all connector methods
- **Integration Patterns**: Best practices for connector integration and data flow
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and debugging techniques for connectors
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, session management, and optimization patterns

## Development Environment Status

- **Architecture**: Fully consolidated modular structure
- **Branding**: Complete ODIN transformation  
- **Testing**: 25/25 tests passing, CLI verified (needs E2E expansion)
- **Backend**: Functional with enhanced data models
- **Documentation**: Needs comprehensive connector system documentation
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Prerequisites met, but testing/docs need enhancement

## Current Data Coverage

- **Currently Extracted**: 61 fields (41% coverage)
- **Phase 2 Target**: +15 additional fields 
- **Total Available**: 150+ fields across all data sources
- **Goal**: Reach 50%+ field coverage with Phase 2

## Critical Issues

- **Web UI**: Currently in poor condition, needs complete redesign with ODIN branding
- **Usability**: UI layout and navigation require significant improvement
- **Color Scheme**: Must implement proper ODIN color palette throughout
- **Testing Coverage**: Need comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure full system works
- **Documentation Gap**: Modular connector system lacks complete documentation

## Notes

- All Phase 1 enhancements (VEDAS, temporal CVSS, product intelligence) are functional
- Backend API exposing all enhanced fields correctly
- CLI entry points (odin_cli.py, start_odin_ui.py) working
- Ready to begin Phase 2 feature development immediately
