# ODIN Security Policy

## **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE**

**WARNING: ODIN currently contains CRITICAL security vulnerabilities that make it unsuitable for production deployment. This tool should only be used in isolated, non-production environments until security remediation is complete.**

## Supported Versions

| Version | Security Status    | Deployment Recommendation |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1.0.x   | CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES | NOT RECOMMENDED - Development/Testing Only |
| < 1.0   | UNSUPPORTED | NOT RECOMMENDED |

## Current Security Posture

### **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED**

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Missing API Authentication**: No authentication mechanism on any API endpoints
- **Missing Authorization Controls**: No access controls on sensitive operations
- **Impact**: Complete unauthorized access to vulnerability research functionality

#### File System Security
- **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities**: Unrestricted file path operations in CLI and reporting
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write**: User-controlled paths allow access to any filesystem location  
- **Impact**: Complete filesystem access, potential data exfiltration

#### Input Validation
- **Missing CVE ID Validation**: No format validation on CVE identifiers
- **Unsafe Parameter Handling**: Direct use of user input without sanitization
- **Impact**: Potential injection attacks, system instability

#### Network Security
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: No protection against DoS attacks
- **Overly Permissive CORS**: Allows all HTTP methods and headers
- **Tool Identification**: User-Agent headers identify this as a security research tool
- **Impact**: Service availability, cross-site attacks, operational security

## Security Remediation Status

### **Immediate Priority (Days 1-3)**
- [ ] Implement API key authentication
- [ ] Add comprehensive path validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add strict CVE ID format validation (CVE-YYYY-NNNN)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints

### **High Priority (Week 1)**
- [ ] Restrict CORS to specific methods and headers only
- [ ] Add request timeouts and resource limits
- [ ] Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] Replace tool-identifying User-Agent strings

### **Medium Priority (Weeks 2-4)**
- [ ] Comprehensive input sanitization across all endpoints
- [ ] Security event logging without information disclosure
- [ ] Data encryption for sensitive information
- [ ] Automated dependency vulnerability scanning

## Alternative: CLI-Centric Architecture

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH**: Transition to CLI-centric architecture that eliminates API security risks entirely:

- **Security Benefit**: Removes entire API attack surface
- **Implementation**: CLI generates files, Web UI consumes static JSON
- **Timeline**: Architecture components already developed and ready for deployment
- **Risk Reduction**: Eliminates 75% of identified security vulnerabilities

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### **For External Security Researchers**

If you discover additional security vulnerabilities in ODIN:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email**: Send details to project maintainers via GitHub security advisories
3. **Include**: 
   - Vulnerability description and impact assessment
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Suggested mitigation if known
   - Your preferred disclosure timeline

### **Response Timeline**
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities within 2 weeks, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### **Current Known Issues**

We are already aware of the following critical security issues:
- Missing API authentication (tracked as internal security issue #1)
- Path traversal vulnerabilities (tracked as internal security issue #2)  
- Missing input validation (tracked as internal security issue #3)
- Missing rate limiting (tracked as internal security issue #4)

## Security Development Practices

### **Current State**
- **Security Review**: Manual security assessment completed (2025-06-18)
- **Automated Scanning**: Not implemented
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Not implemented
- **Penetration Testing**: Not performed

### **Planned Improvements**
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Add dependency vulnerability monitoring
- External security audit before any production consideration
- Regular penetration testing schedule

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to transparent security practices:

1. **Acknowledging Issues**: We publicly acknowledge security vulnerabilities exist
2. **Status Updates**: Regular updates on remediation progress  
3. **Timeline Commitment**: Clear timelines for security fixes
4. **User Communication**: Honest communication about deployment safety

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature
- **Project Issues**: For non-sensitive security process questions only
- **Documentation**: This SECURITY.md file will be updated as remediation progresses
